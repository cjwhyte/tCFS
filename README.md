# tCFS

This repository contains code to reproduce the simulations and analysis reported in the pair of companion papers:

(1) - A Minimal Physiological Model of Perceptual Suppression and Breakthrough in Visual Rivalry: 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.28.656716v1.abstract
(2) - A Minimal Quantitative Model of Perceptual Suppression and Breakthrough in Visual Rivalry: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17154

Code for (1) can be found in the folders BRTD and tCFS1, code for (2) can be found in the tCFS2 folder. Empirical data used in the analysis for (2) can be downloaded from the OSF repo: https://osf.io/nzp9v/
